COMP 016 Web Development

This project involved creating a fully customized e-portfolio website to showcase my progress and work throughout the course. The portfolio was structured into multiple pages including a Home Page, Midterm Page, Final Page, and a Contact Page, each designed to reflect my personal learning journey and technical growth.

Customizing this e-portfolio helped me not only improve my technical skills in HTML and CSS, but also taught me how to present my work in a professional and organized manner. I learned the importance of reflecting on learning experiences and how valuable a portfolio can be in showing growth over time.
